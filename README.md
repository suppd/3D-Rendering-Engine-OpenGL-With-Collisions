#h1 3D Rendering Engine OpenGL With Collisions

## Description & Justification


## Evaluation Proposal
"Benchmark accuracy, speed, memory usage, consistency, (scaling) performance OBB vs AABB colission systems in a simple OpenGL rendering engine"

## Turtorials Used

[AABB Tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection)

[OBB Tutorial](https://github.com/juj/MathGeoLib/blob/master/src/Geometry/OBB.cpp)

[Chrono Library (for testing)] (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono)

## My Setup

[CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-14700KF](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/236789/intel-core-i7-processor-14700kf-33m-cache-up-to-5-60-ghz/specifications.html)

[RAM: 32GB DDR4 3600HZ](https://azerty.nl/product/corsair-vengeance-lpx-geheugen/4069527)

[GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070](https://www.gigabyte.com/Graphics-Card/GV-N4070GAMING-OC-12GD#kf)

[Motherboard: ASUS TUF GAMING B760M-PLUS WIFI D4](https://www.asus.com/motherboards-components/motherboards/tuf-gaming/tuf-gaming-b760m-plus-wifi-d4/)

OS: Windows 10 64-bit

[IDE: Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 (64-bit)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

## Test Procedure

My testing procedure is setup within the code, I will run a few diffrent scenarios all with the same random seed.
My Objective is to compare diffrent benchmarks between my AABB and OBB setups and see how well they do compared to each other.
